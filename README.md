# colorchanger

A Flutter project ( if you didn't notice )

## Getting Started

A project that changes background color ( no you can't control it, it is random )                                   
In the lib folder, you could choose the required color changer ( aka ColorChangerRquired ).                                             
You have the ability to choose the cooler option ( aka ColorChangerCool )
